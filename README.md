**Course:** CSC 788 Graduate Project (Spring 2025)<br/>
**Author**: Minati Alphonso
**Skills**: C#, Unity, Microsoft Visual Studio, Oculus Rift<br/>
**Unity Editor Version**: 6000.0.33f1

## Overview
This is a Virtual Reality (VR) treasure-hunting application developed for the **Oculus Rift**. Users can explore a virtual world, collect gems, interact with a gift box, and navigate a maze with the help of a guiding agent. 

A key highlight of this project is the **GrabEffectBuilder**, an extendable VR tool that allows developers to easily add and configure interaction effects (e.g., haptics, hover, highlight, bounce, etc.) on 3D objects through Unityâ€™s Inspector.

## Features
- **Teleportation System**: Parabolic arc teleport restricted to tagged paths.  
- **Inventory Menu**: Two-handed interaction (both grip buttons) opens a floating, gaze-following inventory with collectible counts and icons.  
- **Collectibles**: Static and blinking gems, a golden key, and a trophy with particle and 3D sound effects.  
- **Gift Box Interaction**: Interactable lid using **GrabEffectBuilder** for customizable grab/hover effects and physics-based bounce.  
- **Maze Navigation**: Runtime-generated maze with a guiding AI agent.  
- **Immersive World**: Day/night cycle, ambient wind sounds, lit lampposts, and custom skybox.
